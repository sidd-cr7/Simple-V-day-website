# Will You Be My Valentine?

This is a small interactive Valentine-themed website built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
Works both on mobile devices and desktops

The site asks a simple question and responds playfully to user interaction. Clicking “No” makes the experience progressively harder, while clicking “Yes” triggers a fun and positive response.

## What it does

- Displays a Valentine question with Yes and No buttons  
- The No button avoids the cursor and changes its text dynamically  
- The Yes button increases in size after repeated No clicks  
- Clicking Yes triggers:
  - A celebratory message
  - Simple animations
  - A few randomly placed cartoon and animal GIFs
  - Soft royalty-free background music
- Includes a cartoony penguin character that reacts to user actions  
- Works on both mobile and desktop devices
